[Samsung Dream Class](https://www.dreamclass.org/index.do) is a youth education program in which college students serve as mentors to middle school students who lack educational resources and support their learning. To prevent insufficient conditions from becoming a gap between dreams, we have introduced an online/offline hybrid education system and provide not only basic learning, but also career and vocational education to form career aspirations, and future competency education that will become basic knowledge in the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution. I am mentoring 6 children at the INHU Youth Center in Jeonju.
