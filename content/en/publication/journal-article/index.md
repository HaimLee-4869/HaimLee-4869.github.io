abstract: Remote Internship is a program in which students from local national universities undergo learning and evaluation for the purpose of training CDS (Citizen Data Scientists), and then carry out a project based on mentoring that allows selected students to gain relevant job experience. I learned data analysis through a remote internship and am currently working on a team project on the topic of 'food desertification'.
