abstract: In the 'Linux Programming' class in the first semester of 2023, we conducted a team project to create a kiosk program using Linux. The kiosk program we created is a system implemented with a Linux-based server-client model. This enables the management and use of kiosks through interaction between servers and clients. I was able to understand programming and network communication concepts using system calls.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
